## Projection of Expectations

For example, if given the verse "I brought you these for your birthday, but weren't around to enjoy them", the player choooses the pair of handcuffs rather than the flowers, then the darkness score of the game increases, leading to a darker ending.

Each verse has multiple valid solutions, given the solution the player chooses, it affects the mood of the game and the ending.

If the choice doesn't make sense, then mabe "I'm not ready to clear this out just yet..."

The mood of the game is reflected in the verse chosen. 

Possible endings:

    very good: Player is moving into new home to start a new family
    good: Player got a promotion at work and is leaving with wife to new town
    neutral: I've been meaning to clean this junk out forever.
    bad:  Player lost job and wife. 
    very bad: Player murdered his wife
